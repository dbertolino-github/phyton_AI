'''
Aims of this exercise:
 - Define a neural network (NN) and its hidden layers using the TensorFlow DNNRegressor class
 - Train a neural network to learn nonlinearities in a dataset and achieve better performance than a linear regression model

In the previous exercises, we used synthetic features to help our model incorporate nonlinearities.
One important set of nonlinearities was around latitude and longitude, but there may be others.
We'll also switch back, for now, to a standard regression task, rather than the logistic regression task from the previous exercise. That is, we'll be predicting median_house_value directly.

The NN is defined by the DNNRegressor class.
Use hidden_units to define the structure of the NN. 
The hidden_units argument provides a list of ints, where each int corresponds to a hidden layer and indicates the number of nodes in it. 
For example, consider the following assignment:

hidden_units=[3,10]

The preceding assignment specifies a neural net with two hidden layers:
 - The first hidden layer contains 3 nodes.
 - The second hidden layer contains 10 nodes.

If we wanted to add more layers, we'd add more ints to the list. 
For example, hidden_units=[10,20,30,40] would create four layers with ten, twenty, thirty, and forty units, respectively.
By default, all hidden layers will use ReLu activation and will be fully connected.

Here we'll try to tune some NN basic parameters and observ results.
We can also compare them with exercises in 0_linear_regression folder.

Overfitting is a real potential hazard for NNs. 
You can look at the gap between loss on training data and loss on validation data to help judge if your model is starting to overfit. 
If the gap starts to grow, that is usually a sure sign of overfitting.

NOTE: 
Next selections of parameters are somewhat arbitrary. 
Here we've tried combinations that are increasingly complex, combined with training for longer, until the error falls below our objective. 
This may not be the best combination; others may attain an even lower RMSE. 
If your aim is to find the model that can attain the best error, then you'll want to use a more rigorous process, like a parameter search.
